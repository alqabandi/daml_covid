# Ecomonic impact of Covid-19. 

In this repository, I combine:  

* Historical, as well as daily covid data, by state, from [Covid Tracking](https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily). Which state by state information about the total number of tests conducted, total number of positive covid cases etc. There are also _some_ information on total number of covid patients hospitalized and on ventilators.   
* Historical and weekly unemployment insurance claims data, by state, from the St. Louis Fed [i.e. FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=180&eid=259008)  
* Population estimates for each state, from the [Census](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html#par_textimage)  
* Dates the each state declared an emergency, and/or declared some sort of shelter-in-place or stay-at-home order.  

After cloning the repository, you can explore the data by running the [notebook](https://github.com/alqabandi/daml_covid/blob/master/visuals.ipynb) as is.  

I hope to add more social/demographic information as they come through, so I will update this page accordingly.
